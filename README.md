M5STACK ESP32 Arduino

This radar app shows "covid trace" beacons transmitted around you.
The distance from the centre are related to the strength of the received signal.

THESE ARE NOT infections but people that have the corona alert app installed.

Works with the standard BLE Arduino lib that is installed with Arduino 1.9.

Versions 2 and 3 other visualisations. I try to make it looks as cool as possible :-)
